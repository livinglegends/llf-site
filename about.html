                <h4>History</h4>
                <p class="p-lg">The Living Legends Foundation (LLF) is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit, tax-exempt organization first founded in Los Angeles in 1991 and incorporated in 1992, by record industry icon Ray Harris, record executives Barbara Lewis and C.C. Evans and radio programming legend Jerry Boulding. The organization has been funded primarily with corporate contributions and individual donations. Initial funding was provided from the sale of tickets to the first annual Living Legends Dinner, which was held on April 22, 1993 at the site of the Impact Conference at The Bally&#39;s Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey.</p>
                <p class="p-lg">The original purpose of The Living Legends Foundation was to recognize and honor legendary music and radio industry figures who have distinguished themselves by their contributions as trailblazers, trendsetters, teachers and/or mentors. The Living Legends Foundation is an organization dedicated to recognizing those members of the entertainment industry whose efforts and contributions have paved the way for many in the entertainment industry, especially, minorities and women. Many of those opportunities are in the areas of recorded music, radio broadcasting and retail (record stores).</p>
                <h4>The Mission Statement</h4>
                <p class="p-lg">The Living Legends Foundation is dedicated to preserving the rich legacy of those who shape America’s broadcast and recording industries. The LLF honors those unsung heroes whose efforts might otherwise go unnoticed.</p>
                <p class="p-lg">The LLF exists because of a need to recognize and promote the achievements of those members of the radio, music and entertainment industries and to help secure their place in history.</p>
                <h4>The Foundation Today</h4>
                <p class="p-lg">Over the years the LLF has expanded its mission from just recognizing the achievements of the trailblazers of yesterday but today&#39;s new trailblazers who are breaking glass ceilings and achieving professional heights once thought impossible.</p>
                <p class="p-lg">Since its inception, the LLF has provided assistance to those in need and reviews those requests on a case by case basis. Recipients must have made his/her primary livelihood as a member of the industry (active or inactive) and provide proof of need to be considered for assistance.</p>
                <p class="p-lg">Unfortunately, unlike today with corporate pension plans and 401K options many of the early pioneers were left without healthcare, life insurance, retirement funds and other benefits to sustain them when their careers were over. However, despite the corporate perks available today, the volatile nature of the industry can cause anyone to become unemployed without notice. Over the years the LLF has provided more than $100,000 in assistance to those in need. The foundation has become a “Bridge over troubled waters” for many.</p>
                <p class="p-lg">Another area of expansion is the area of Education and Mentoring. Members of the Foundation’s board participate in school “Career Days”. The Foundation is also a resource of knowledge for today’s younger music executives seeking guidance in their careers.</p>
                <p class="p-lg">The Foundation has also hosts a Celebrity Golf Tournament as an alternative fundraiser featuring players from the NFL, NBA and music entertainers.</p>
