Winston Willis, better known as &#39;Buzzy&#39; has been a true innovator and industry pioneer
for all of his over 25 years in the music industry. Born and raised in Harlem, Buzz thrived
on the creative and cultural energy that surrounded him. He attended De Witt Clinton
High School and was a member of The Solitaires, a high school doo-wop group that was
later inducted into the R&amp;B Hall of Fame. After school he worked as a stock boy for
Royal Roost/Roulette Records before going away to Case Weston University in
Cleveland, Ohio, on a basketball and scholastic scholarship. Back from college, he didn&#39;t
miss a &quot;note&quot; but continued his career in music doing local promotion for MGM/Verve
Records.

Mr. Willis then joined the staff of RCA Records in New York and proved he had the
&quot;Midas touch.&quot; With a string of gold records to his credit, his ride to the top was in
meteoric style. He holds the distinction of being the youngest Vice President of that
company, and for creating the first Black Music Division for the label. It was under his
guidance the careers of Jose Feliciano, The Main Ingredient and Hues Corporation were
nurtured. Buzzy Willis still found the time to pursue his graduate studies at Pace
University in marketing.

His astute business savvy did not go unnoticed and he was soon recruited by Phillips
Electronics Corporation (parent company of Polydor/Polygram Records) to be the Senior
Vice President of all American Operations. Always rising to the challenge, Mr. Willis
proved that he could conquer the context of corporate politics by being instrumental in
the acquisition of Mercury and Verve Records by Phillips. In his capacity as Senior Vice
President, he was responsible for the marketing strategies for such world renowned
artists as James Brown, Joe Simon and Millie Jackson. A true trailblazer, it was time for
Mr. Willis to conquer new territory, so he accepted the position of Chief Executive Officer
of CTI Records, the largest jazz record label in the world. Once again, it was the
innovative marketing skills, industry acumen and innate creativity of Willis that propelled
the successes of jazz greats Grover Washington Jr., George Benson, and Esther
Phillips. Mr. Willis was personally responsible for the music industry&#39;s first platinum jazz
album - &quot;Mr. Magic&quot; by Grover Washington, Jr. Respected by many as a marketing
genius, he created the blue prints of success for such artists as the multi-platinum Kool
&amp; The Gang, Sister Sledge and Alexander O&#39;Neal.

In May 1996, Mr. Willis launched One World Entertainment, Ltd. in partnership with The
Sanctuary Group (UK), one of the largest management firms in Europe. OWE, Ltd.
boasts on impressive roster that includes the likes of Bon Jovi, Iron Maiden, Wasp and
Halloween. The Sanctuary Group is partners with the BBC, producing three specials a
year for the network.

OWE, Ltd. provides a myriad of services such as artist management, tour direction,
record production, contract negotiations, video production and concert tour promotion.
As President and CEO of OWE, Ltd., Mr. Willis and his partners, Robert &quot;Kool&quot; Bell and
industry veteran Cecil Holmes, have assembled a collection of talent that is on the
cutting edge and represents today&#39;s hottest sounds. Unlike so many of his
contemporaries that are confined to the parameters of a specific category, Mr. Willis has
proven that his abilities transcend the barriers of musical genres. OWE Ltd., in union
with 89 5th Records, Inc., will feature contemporary music crossing all musical genres
and also provide manufacturing and distribution services for new labels.

An active community leader, Willis has been recognized for his personal as well as
professional contributions. He has been named Young Businessman of the Year by the
New York Urban League and the National Council of Negro Women. Listed in the
&quot;Who&#39;s Who in America,&quot; he was appointed Minority Market Consultant for the
Department of Defense under the Carter Administration, Entertainment Consultant to the
United Nations&#39; 50th Anniversary and named Chairman of the Cultural Affairs
Commission of Jersey City, New Jersey. Winston &quot;Buzzy&quot; Willis remains one of the
most influential movers in the music industry.
