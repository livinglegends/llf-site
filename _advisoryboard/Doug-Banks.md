The Philadelphia-born, Detroit raised Banks began his radio career broadcasting on his high school's radio station. Local station WDRQ took notice of his talent and offered him a spot as a temporary late-night weekend disc jockey for a country station. After high school, he managed to turn his temporary trial into a permanent multi-year gig at KDAY in Los Angeles, California. He then moved on to the LA station KFI, which helped to pave the way to a morning show slot in Las Vegas at KLAV-AM. Doug's next two stops were KDIA in San Francisco and WBMX (now WVAZ) in Chicago, Illinois. 

From 1986 to 1994, Banks did nights then a morning show for WGCI-FM. Next, the ABC Radio Network offered Banks the opportunity to do a nationally syndicated show. The Doug Banks Morning Show, hosted by Banks along with DeDe McGuire, rose to become one of the top-rated syndicated urban programs in America. In January 2008, the show was cancelled, but Banks relaunched the show this time in the afternoon drive under the new name The Ride with Doug and DeDe in the process.
