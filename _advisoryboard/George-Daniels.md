Known as the &quot;Godfather&quot; of independent retailers, George&#39;s Music Room, based
on Chicago&#39;s southside, has become legendary and a must stop for any Urban
artists looking to sell records in Chicago. What was once called a &quot;Mom and Pop&quot;
store has grown to multiple locations including Chicago&#39;s Midway Airport with a
location soon to open in Chicago&#39;s busiest travel center, O&#39;Hare Airport.

Mr. Daniels has provided leadership to independent retailers, breaking into ranks
once reserved for only the chains or mega-stores. Artists have sought his advice
from the legendary Isley Brothers to Chicago&#39;s own R. Kelly. Mr. Daniels has
appeared in numerous videos by today&#39;s hottest artists and has hosted shows for
BET. George Daniels is a living legend.
