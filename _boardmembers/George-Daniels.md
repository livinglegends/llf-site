Known as the "Godfather" of independent retailers: George's Music Room, based on Chicago's southside, has become legendary and a must stop for any Urban artists looking to sell records in Chicago. What was once called a "Mom and Pop" store has grown to multiple locations including Chicago's Mid-Way Airport with a location soon to open in Chicago's busiest travel center, O'Hare Airport. George has provided leadership to independent retailers, breaking into ranks once reserved for only the chains or mega-stores. Artists have sought his advice from the legendary Isley Brothers to Chicago's own R. Kelly. George has appeared in numerous videos by today's hottest artists and has hosted shows for BET. George himself is a living legend.
