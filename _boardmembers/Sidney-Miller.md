Mr. Miller is the founder and publisher of Black Radio Exclusive (BRE), the first
and oldest trade publication dedicated to highlighting and exploiting the world of
urban music. Sidney started his career in music as a musician and a concert
promoter while attending Florida A&amp;M University (FAMU) in Tallahassee, Florida.
His classmates included famed musicians Nat and Cannonball Adderley. After
serving his country in the U.S. Army, the former First Lieutenant eventually joined
Capitol Records. While at Capitol Records, he managed the entire promotion
department providing promotional strategies for such diverse acts such as Helen
Reddy, the Fortunes and his former classmate Cannonball Adderley. Upon
forming his own management and promotions company, Sidney created the
marketing strategy for the landmark soundtrack to the movie &quot;Car Wash&quot;, which
became MCA Records largest selling soundtrack at that time.

In 1976, noting the lack of attention given to Black music, which accounted for
over 60% of the $6 billion music industry, he launched BRE, which has grown
from its initial 1,000 copies to an internationally read publication. His annual BRE
Conventions brought together the &quot;movers and shakers&quot; of both the
entertainment, civil rights and political worlds, where vital information has been
shared in an effort to further advance the cause of Black music and those who
create and market it. The highlight of each convention was the awards dinner
where winners received the &quot;Drummer Award,&quot; which was commissioned by the
publisher to represent the African tradition of mass communication. Sidney has
proven to be a visionary, which lead to his creation of the first syndicated satellite
program &quot;Hollywood Live,&quot; hosted by the late legendary radio programmer
Frankie Crocker. Today satellite broadcasting is the norm but Sidney, as the
saying goes, was &quot;slightly ahead of his time.&quot; In addition to being on the LLF
Board, Sidney is involved in The Recording Academyâ€™s MusiCares Foundation,
the Evander Holyfield Foundation, Washington D.C. Music Commission among
others. He has received numerous awards including the prestigious NAACP
Image Award.
