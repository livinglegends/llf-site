This Temple University graduate, known as VJ to those in the industry, has
enjoyed an illustrious career serving in many senior management capacities. Mr.
Johnson has held a variety of senior management positions at EMI (Capitol and
Manhattan/Blue Note Records), Universal Music Group (Island Records) and
BMG (Jive Records). During his tenure in the EMI Records family he was chosen
to serve as Vice President for the new label Manhattan/Blue Note Records (now
the home of Norah Jones.) resulting in Bobby McFerren&#39;s classic &quot;Don&#39;t Worry Be
Happy.&quot;

It was Mr. Johnson&#39;s sense for talent that led him as Vice President Artist &amp;
Repertoire/ Promotion to sign such Platinum artists as Freddie Jackson, Tina
Turner, George Clinton and Ashford &amp; Simpson. He was among the first minority
executives to have the power to sign acts and create and execute the marketing
plans for those acts. His work with Frankie Beverly and Maze led to the landmark
recording &quot;Frankie Beverly &amp; Maze Live in New Orleans&quot; and his strategies help
transform Tina Turner from a R&amp;B star to an international pop star.

During his tenure as Senior Vice President at Jive Records, R. Kelly, The Fresh
Prince (Will Smith) &amp; Jazzy Jeff and the late Aaliyah all got their first taste of
success due to Mr. Johnson&#39;s efforts. At Island, in a similar capacity, he helped
sign and re-tool the image of the legendary Isley Brothers, introducing them to a
new legion of fans especially their front man Ron Isley, known to today&#39;s
audiences as &quot;Mr. Big.&quot; Today, Mr. Johnson manages his own Junes
Entertainment Company, still providing his expertise to many of today&#39;s leading
music companies.
