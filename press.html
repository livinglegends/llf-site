            <p>My perspective on music and the music industry is drawn from my 30+ years in the business. I came to New York City in the fall of 1981 with the express purpose of working in the music industry―marketing and publicity, specifically. Since then...<a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-state-of-black-music-and-beyond-weve-had-three_us_57bc2b2ee4b007f18199b932">&nbsp;more</a></p>

            <p>For someone who grew up loving music of all genres—especially black music—and turned that love into a career, it’s bittersweet to look at the current state of black music. Now when I look at black music, I don’t look at the creative process as much as I look at the business side. Creatively, every generation...<a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-state-of-black-music-and-beyond-looking-through_us_57c75f09e4b07addc4105886?vhyy">&nbsp;more</a></p>

            <p>While driving my teens in the car, I turn over the reins of music programmer to them as they navigate through the thousands of songs available for streaming via my paid Spotify account. From Drake, Kendrick Lamar and Beyoncé to Jennifer Hudson and Jay-Z, we take turns picking songs while I play the sample or song that influenced today’s hit. I find...<a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-state-of-black-music-and-beyond-maintaining-our_us_57cd5cd4e4b07addc4137e4b">&nbsp;more</a></p></p>

            <p>For the baby boomers among us, you may recall the days when we listened to music on vinyl discs: first 78 rpm, then singles on 45 rpm with albums and 12” singles on 33 rpm vinyl discs. It was cumbersome and required a bulky phonograph-record player to listen to our favorite songs. For a short spell...<a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/57d203ffe4b0f831f7071970?timestamp=1473381646845">&nbsp;more</a></p></p>

            <p>I’ve devoted my career to developing, guiding and protecting successful artist brands as a manager and former public relations practitioner. I’ve chased the dream of grabbing “15 minutes of fame” for my clients and probably over 90% have been African-American.
