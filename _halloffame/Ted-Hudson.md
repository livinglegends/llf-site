Ted Hudson believed that the easiest way to sum up his forty-six years in the music industry was to say, "Time flies when you're having fun." Mr. Hudsonâ€™s whole family enjoyed music. They would frequently patronize the only African American music store in St. Louis. In 1950, he realized the popularity of this entertainment medium, and its potential for growth. As a result, he opened his first retail record store, "Hudson's Embassy Records, Inc." The logo was a phonograph record with the credo "First with the Latest" emblazoned on the rim. 

The "Embassy" portion of that name came from the concept that American Embassies serve as safe havens for American Citizens overseas. He wanted to give artists a safe and friendly outlet for their music and music lovers a safe and friendly place to listen to and purchase music. By 1982, Hudson's Embassy Records, Inc. expanded to eleven retail record stores. In addition, the concept for "Hudson's Embassy" was franchised six times. In 1965, he opened one of the first African-American owned distribution companies, serving approximately 100 independent record labels and artists with distributions along the Eastern seaboard, Midwest and Southeast. 

Ted's One Stop, Inc. opened in 1968 as a wholesale operation servicing local and regional retail record stores. He also opened an advertising/promotional agency, a recording studio for independent record labels and artists and an electronics wholesale business. Mr. Hudson considered himself fortunate to have been a founding member of the National Association of Television and Radio Announcers (NATRA) and the Black Music Association (BMA).  After resigning his political office as Committeeman of the 19th Ward of the City of St. Louis, Mr. and Mrs. Hudson sat back and enjoyed life's little pleasures.
