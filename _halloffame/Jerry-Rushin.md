Jerry Rushin is dedicated to the preservation of Black music. He furthered these efforts with his executive positions at WEDR-FM and WRBD-AM. 

Mr. Rushin was born in Georgia and reared in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. He returned from the Army to resume his high school job at a furniture store. He was passed by for promotions because the senior management did not believe the other workers would take orders from a Black man.   He then decided to change career paths, following in his brother's footsteps, by going to broadcasting school. After finishing school, he landed a job at WEDR-FM as a part-time announcer. Rushin knew from his previous experience that he had to be better than good because of his color. He gained more responsibilities with full time positions as R&B Announcer, Program Director, and in 1980, he became Vice President/General Manager. 

While many radio professionals were moving from station to station, Mr. Rushin took the time to invest in WEDR. He brought the station from 16,000 watts in the â€˜70's to 100,000 watts. He credits his mentor and broadcasting school instructor Bob Gaynor in helping him make productive career choices.  His secret to success has been his ability to look at the long range picture. He was more concerned with making good career moves than finding a job. 

Mr. Rushin credits WEDR's success to being faithful to the Black format. He  believes in Black people and their causes and helps by being involved in the rebuilding of the Black community. He was also involved in the rebuilding of WRBD-AM, the station he purchased in a joint venture with James Thomas and WEDR. They picked up the troubled station and were committed to turning it around. The two ventures (WEDR-AM and WRBD-FM) worked together until the sale of WRBD in 1997. 
In 1980, Mr. Rushin was named general manager, and later Miami VP and Market Manager for Cox Media Group, which, in addition to WEDR, included WFLC 97.3 FM, WHQT 105.1 FM, and WFEZ 93.1 FM.   He retired from Cox Media in 2012 after 40 years in radio.
