If you've ever been to Kansas City, chances are that you've heard of Dell Rice.  For the past 25 years, Dell has been the voice of that city's jazz & R&B stations.  Mr. & Mrs. Skip Carter were the first to notice Mr. Rice's cool professionalism, and hired him at their station KPRS after he'd been in broadcasting school for just three months.  His rise through the ranks was swift, and in just under two years he became Assistant Program Director.

In 1971, Mr. Rice was made Program Director at KUDL-FM and was hosting a show on its AM sister station.  As his talents became more widely known, his career expanded dramatically.  He was chosen to be the Master of Ceremonies for several jazz concerts held in Kansas City's Royal Stadium.  There he shared the stage with performers such as George Benson, Teddy Pendergrass, Natalie Cole and Chaka Khan.

After returning to KPRS in 1972 as Program Director, Mr. Rice was afforded the chance to give back some of the love and support that the community had bestowed on him throughout his career.   As a local celebrity, he spoke to high school and elementary school students, volunteering his time and knowledge of broadcasting to inform the city's students of the many opportunities they might have with a career in radio, television or journalism.    He also held seminars at the University of Kansas.  The local chapters of The Boys and Girls clubs are also thankful to him for his extensive volunteer work with them.

Mr. Rice credits a natural affinity towards music, that is, having been born with an "ear" for it, that led a jazz CD that he'd co-written with the Max Groove Jazz Group to number 12 on Billboard's 1998 Jazz charts.  "Midnight Rain" on the Optimism label is considered by many critics to be a splendid recording of contemporary jazz.
