He's been called the "Fly Jock" and the "Hardest Working Man in Radio." Now Tom Joyner is the ultimate breakfast host as star of “The Tom Joyner Morning Show”, heard in over 100 markets nationwide through his syndication company, Reach Media. Each weekday Mr. Joyner invites a nationwide audience, via the radio waves, into his studio home.   

This live, syndicated national urban morning program treats listeners to an on-air team that reports and comments on the latest news and sports of interest to the audience. Also featured are drop-in celebrity guests, an in-house band, on-site remotes and an audience-tested urban playlist. Weaving it all together is Mr. Joyner's upbeat altitude, energy and humorous insights.

  A four-time Billboard Magazine award winner, Mr. Joyner began his radio career immediately after he graduated from college. The Tuskegee, Alabama native had received his bachelor's degree in sociology from Tuskegee Institute when a friend offered him a news broadcasting job at Montgomery, Alabama's WRMA-AM.

  After his debut on Montgomery's airwaves, Mr. Joyner worked on air at WIOK-AM, Memphis; KVYK-AM, St. Louis; and KKDA-FM, Dallas. His success eventually brought him to Chicago where he entertained Windy City audiences at WJPC-FM, WGCI-FM, WVON-AM and WBMX-FM.   Mr. Joyner made headlines in the mid-1980s when accepted the simultaneous positions of morning drive man at KKDA-FM and afternoon drive talent at WGGI-FM. His daily round trip commute between Dallas and Chicago earned him national publicity, high ratings and millions of frequent flyer miles.

  In addition to his collection of Billboard "Best Urban Contemporary Air Personality" awards, Joyner has received IMPACT Publication's Joe Loris Award for Excellence in Broadcasting. As an added honor, IMPACT’s Best Radio Personality of the Year Award was renamed The Tom Joyner Award because he received it so many times. Joyner resides in Dallas and has two adult sons, Thomas Jr. and Oscar.
