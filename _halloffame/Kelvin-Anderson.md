Kelvin Anderson was the owner and driving force behind the well-named "World Famous V.I.P. Records", in Long Beach, California.
Upon moving to Los Angeles in May 1972, fresh out of high school in Mississippi, Mr. Anderson began his music career working for his oldest brother Cletus Anderson, the founder of V.I.P. Records. He credited most of his success in the business to his brother's teachings and on the job training.  He worked for Cletus for six years. During that time V.I.P. Records became one of the most successful independent retailers on the west coast and a household name.

After opening several successful stores in the Los Angeles area, Cletus opened V.I.P. Records in Long Beach. In January 1979, Cletus offeredÂ the Long Beach location to Kelvin, and Kelvin grabbed the chance of a lifetime and built his career in music.
For over 2 decades V.I.P. Records grew to become one of the most recognized stores in the nation, and is known around the world as the location where 'Snoop Doggy Dog' filmed his first of several music videos. Kelvin Anderson is well known in the music industry because of his knowledge, dedication, aggressiveness and the ability to survive.

He is also known to be outspoken regarding the well-being and survival of independent retailers.  Mr. Anderson is the president of the United Independent Music Retailers Association (UIMRA) of Southern California and started his own production company, "At Last V.I.P. Entertainment", working to develop new talent. His goal this year is to secure a major production or label deal that would create an avenue in which to release artists he has signed.
