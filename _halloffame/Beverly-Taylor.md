As the owner of The Joy of Music in Cleveland, Beverly Taylor was down-to-earth, savvy, and hardworking. She also did radio promotion for Columbia, Tommy Boy, Rap-A-Lot, and Maverick Records and worked retail promotion for other powerhouses such as Epic/Sony, Arista and Motown.

Ms. Taylor caught the entrepreneurial spirit after working in another record store and started her own store with seven hundred fifty dollars. She developed her business into more than a simple store. It is a community center, a cultural explosion, and a musical mecca where she was affectionately known as "Ma." With seven schools in the area, she had plenty of opportunities to talk one-on-one with young people about their Blackness and the importance of excellence. 

Her boundless energy was also spent as President of retail coalition SIMMS of America, where she worked to promote economic strength and community action. While she worked on projects such as voter registration drives and benefits for a battered women's shelter, she also thought it was important to take time to talk to people, to try to help them, to touch their lives.
