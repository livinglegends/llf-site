Claude “B.B.” Davis got started in this business by accident. The first black owned radio station in Shreveport, KOKA, was raising money for the needy. Mr. Davis had pledged some money and no one ever came to pick it up so he decided to drop it off one Sunday.  B.B. says, “There was only one person at the station that day, Bill "Omar" Jackson. He let me stay in the control booth and I asked him a bunch of questions about everything. After that, I went back every Sunday. One Sunday Omar walked out of the office and left me by myself. So I opened up the mike and started giving out the station identification. Eventually, the station manager signed me on to do a gospel show from sun up until noon. I was paid fifty cents an hour.”

After five years of working part time on the gospel show, Mr. Davis got his shot at the R & B show one day when the regular jock didn't show up. He was at KOKA for 30 years, until the station was bought by KVKI where he hosted “The Night Flight with B.B., Bird Brain, Davis." His nickname, the "Bird Brain" comes from a joke he was telling about the 1955 Apollo space mission. He said, "The Apollo went up today, it's gonna go up again. Next time I'm gonna go up as an interpreter." Well, a listener liked the joke so much, he sent a letter addressed to the Bird Brain Davis. From then on, he opened his show as B.B. (Bird Brain) Davis.
