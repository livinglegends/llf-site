Wherever radio signals travel, Willie Mitchell's music has been heard. For more that four decades now, "Pops", as he's known within the industry, has been writing, arranging, producing and playing on hit records. The purity of his sound has become a signature trademark. Soft, tough, elegant and junky no one does what Pops does. He is rightfully accredited as one of soul music's greatest producers.

Willie Mitchell's talent was recognized at an early age. Before he could finish high school, several big bands were recruiting his talents on the trumpet, and he was also asked to play on B.B. King's first recordings. Rust College became his base soon after, and from there Willie Mitchell be-bopped as a part of the special services band that backed Vic Damone. Upon being discharged, Willie formed a jazz band and signed with Hi Records in 1961. Hi wanted him because of the hits he'd produced on the label for the Bill Black Combo. From there his name underscored Ace Cannon's pivotal bestsellers, and then Willie began making a radio signature of his own, scoring a string of 22 instrumental hits in the sixties that were defined by "Soul Serenade" and "2075" that made the Willie Mitchell band consistently the hottest touring band in the world. As the 70's dawned, after ten years a beloved, accomplished, best-selling and respected player, Willie Mitchell's switched hats to a full-time producer and recreated history.

Al Green, Ann Peebles, O.V. Wright, Denise LaSalle, Syl Johnson, Hi Rhythm - to connoisseurs of rhythm & blues, such a roster constitutes an impressive field of heavyweights style called southern soul. All were discovered and brought to media life by Mr. Willie Mitchell. No one could reproduce the Mitchell sound, and the public ate it up. Willie produced 22 Gold & Platinum records with Al Green alone. He mastered the recording of Ann Peebles' signature "I Can't Stand The Rain" during this same period, and directed the touring bands that wowed sold out-audiences throughout the world. Willie Mitchell has produced tracks for Ike & Tina Turner, Bobby Bland, Paul Butterfield, Jesse Winchester, David Hudson, Lynn White, and Rufus Thomas. He is a Memphis music legend and a recording industry icon, deservedly recognized with a Grammy Award in 1986.

Willie Mitchell has always been an unselfish talent, serving on the Executive Board of the Memphis Music Foundation, the Beale Street Foundation, and was appointed to the Tennessee Film, Tape, and Music Commission to lend his particular expertise in a way that would help the city's recording industry.

Willie Mitchell made his transition in 2010, in his beloved Memphis, Tn.
