Bruce Webb's first exposure to the record industry as an employee came in 1960, through Progress Record Distributors, which was housed in the Majestic Hotel located at Broad and Girard Avenue. Hired to do sales and promotion, he started Joe E. Rack, servicing independent supermarkets with cut out records. Mr. Webb decided to start his first record shop.

In 1963, along with three other friends, Mr. Webb started a department store named Throughgoods. In 1967, going on his own, he changed the name to Webb Through-goods. In 1968, it became Webb's Department Store. In 1963, he joined Scoop USA News Paper, as entertainment editor which is a position that he currently holds today. Along the way with King James, Paul Mosby and Mr. Ray, he started BRAT's Record One Stop, with seventy-five other black retailers.

Bruce Webb became an active member of the Black Music Association, and a few years later, along with David Brown and King James, he started Triangle Record Distributors, servicing independent record labels. An active member of the NAACP since 1963, Mr. Webb spent fourteen years in politics and several community organizations honored him with several awards: NAACP Outstanding Service Awards of the West Philadelphia branch; the Black Panther Party; the Girl Scouts; Black Peoples University and BMA, to name a few. In 1972, Mr. Webb and John Martin were instrumental in starting the Wharton Education Community Program. At the Wharton School, part of the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Webb taught Blacks from the community how to become entrepreneurs.

Recently, he started Mister Webb's Consultant & Public Relation Strategist. Mr. Webb says he's still moving on, looking for the next project and the next experience.
