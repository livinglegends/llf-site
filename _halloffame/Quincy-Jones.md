Is there anything that hasn't been said by the man called "Q"? Entrepreneur, record producer, arranger, songwriter, musician, film producer... a man who has won countless awards (including 25 Grammys) and accolades.

A partial list of the Chicago-born maestro's credits include stints as a trumpeter with Lionel Hampton, musical director for Dizzy Gillespie's band, record producer for Dinah Washington and Sarah Vaughn, Vice President of A&R at Mercury Records, composer of major film scores ("The Pawnbroker," "In The Heat Of The Night," "In Cold Blood"); hit maker, through his own albums "Body Heat," "Mellow Madness," "I Heard That," "Sounds... And Stuff Like That," and production work on Michael Jackson's "Off The Wall," Aretha Franklin, The Brothers Johnson, James Ingram, Patti Austin, Rufus & Chaka Khan, George Benson & Tevin Campbell.   

Since the beginning of the 80's, Quincy Jones has produced some of the best-selling albums in history, Michael Jackson's "Thriller," and the landmark "We Are The World" single; worked on the hit movie "The Color Purple," launched Qwest Records, returned to the top of the charts with his 1990 multiplatinum album "Back On The Block," and been the subject of the film "Listen Up: The Lives Of Quincy Jones."
