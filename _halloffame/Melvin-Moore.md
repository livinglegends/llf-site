Oklahoma-born Melvin Moore began his show business career 56 years ago as a vocalist with a number of big bands, including groups led by Ernie Fields, Dizzy Gillespie and Fletcher Henderson. In 1952, through Ruth Bowen, Moore joined the world-famous Ink Spots as a singer and drummer and literally traveled the globe with the group until 1963. 
In 1964, renowned record exec Joe Medlin introduced Moore to the world of promotion and he became National Promotion man for Decca Records. In 1970, Moore left to join Brunswick Records, where he worked records by such artists as Jackie Wilson, The Chi-Lites, Tyrone Davis and Bohannon. Until his death Moore continued working as an independent promotion consultant for several independent New York-based labels.
