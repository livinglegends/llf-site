“One thing I can say about my career is that it has been varied and productive.”

Eddie O’Jay began his radio career in 1951 as a disc jockey at WOKY in Milwaukee. From there, he went to WABQ in Cleveland and WUFO in Buffalo, finally working his way to the "Soul at Sunrise" show on WWRL, WBLS and WLIB in New York City. After a distinguished 27 year career in radio in the United States, he expanded to include an internationally syndicated radio program on "Swazi Music Radio," in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1980.

Because of the familiarity and popularity of his voice, he was nominated and inducted into the Black Radio Hall of Fame. You've probably heard his voice on commercials for Chevrolet, Schlitz Malt Liquor, Sears, Perdue Chicken, Lipton Tea, Campbell's Soup and on "Sesame Street." He was also privileged to have performed in theatrical productions which emanated from the Karamu House in Cleveland such as "My Sister Eileen," "Wonderful Town," "Golden Boy," and "The Connection."

He was fortunate to have discovered while at WABQ, a fine group of five young beginners in the business called The Mascots from Canton and Masilon, Ohio. He was asked to manage and direct the group which took his name, The O'Jays. The rest, as they say, is history.
