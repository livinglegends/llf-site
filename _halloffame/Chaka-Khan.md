As her record company biography points out so accurately, "There's only one Chaka Khan." The Chicago born vocalist has influenced virtually an entire generation of female singers through her distinctive, fiery, soulful sound. Starting out singing locally at the age of 15, Chaka was barely out of her teens when she found herself at the top of the charts with the group Rufus, whose Stevie Wonder-penned "Tell me Something Good" became a major hit in 1974.

  Recording classic albums and hit singles with Rufus (including "Sweet Thing," "Once You Get Started," "Ain't Nobody" and "Everlasting Love") Chaka established her vocal identity with audiences the world over. In 1978, she launched a highly successful solo career with the songs "I'm Every Woman," "What'cha Gonna Do for Me" and the across the board smash "I Feel for You."
