Ms. Green was appointed General Manager of WJLB-FM April 1982 and led WJLB through the most comprehensive turnaround in ratings and sales in the history of Detroit radio. This turnaround encompassed aggressive recruitment of new talent and management, tightly focused marketing, consistent pricing, and a firm commitment to community service.

In 1982, Green initiated Detroit's Coats for Kids, a program that has distributed over 200,000 coats to needy children. This program has been copied in cities all across the United States. Since she began her radio career with WJLB, Ms. Green has ensured that listeners have access to major national entertainment and has overseen WJLB's presentations of massive free concerts, such as Ladies Night Out and family Fun Day. Ms. Green was promoted to Vice President in 1986, and in 1994 her responsibilities were increased to include managing the powerful FM urban duopoly of WJLB-FM and WMXD-FM (Mix 92.3).

Ms. Green's performance is unique in that she is the only African American woman in the country to lead a radio station in a top-ten broadcast market to first place ratings in all major demographics- not just once, but for many successive rating periods. WJLB has been the number one FM in Detroit since 1985 and is currently Detroit's top ranked radio station in all major demos. Throughout her broadcast career, Ms. Green has demanded that African American consumers be treated with dignity in commercial messages and in promotional activity.

Prior to broadcasting, Ms. Green's experience included organization development, marketing, human resources management and labor relations in the automotive and health care industries. A native of Detroit Mich., she is a graduate of Cass Technical High School. She earned a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Wayne State University and her MBA from Michigan State University through its Advanced Management Program.

Ms. Green is a graduate of the Greater Detroit Chamber of Commerce's LEADERSHIP DETROIT program, where she served as Vice Chair of the Board of Trustees. Ms. Green was recently elected to represent the state of Michigan on the Radio Board of Directors of the National Association of Broadcasters. She is active in many civic, service and professional organizations and has been recognized with many civic awards. Ms. Green is the proud mother of two sons.
