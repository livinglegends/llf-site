August Sims adopted his independent spirit from boxer Sugar Ray Robinson and singer Jackie Wilson during his early days on the road with the two of them. These two legends opened doors by introducing Sims to people who otherwise may have remained inaccessible. 

In his hometown of Cleveland, Ohio, Mr. Sims was doing his own thing. As a professional dancer, he danced the Lindy Hop in local clubs before moving to New York. After serving in the Army, he returned to New York where he began frequenting Uptown clubs. It was then he first met Sugar Ray Robinson. Soon he became his masseur and for the next 11 years he traveled the world with Sugar Ray, staying with him until his last fight. 

Ironically, it was in the same Harlem setting that Mr. Sims met Jackie Wilson. Mr. Wilson took an instant liking to him and asked him to join his management team. Mr. Sims became Jackie Wilsonâ€™s manager and right hand man. He stayed with Mr. Wilson until his fateful stroke. Fortunately while touring with Jackie Wilson, Mr. Sims met many industry professionals who later played a major part in future business ventures. He started his own record company, Asoma Records and Tapes, which lasted only a short while. Problems ensued with his label, which forced Mr. Sims to go into the field of independent promotion. Soon he realized that keeping track of store sales was as important as getting airplay. In 1987, Asoma Records became Asoma Marketing. It was there that he perfected his marketing skills. He marketed the product of Lalah Hathaway, Luther Vandross, Gladys Knight, Janet Jackson and Keith Sweat.
Prior to his death, you would find him in his box seats at Yankee Stadium.
