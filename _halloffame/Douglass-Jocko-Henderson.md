Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Douglass “Jocko” Henderson was the youngest of three sons whose father, Elmer, was the first “Director of Colored Schools" for Baltimore (an elementary school bears his name). He graduated from Douglas High School in Baltimore and attended Tuskegee Institute in Alabama majoring in biology. His first on-air position was in 1952 at WSID in Baltimore. He continued in Philadelphia at WHAT than at WDAS. While on the air in Philadelphia, Jocko commuted to New York to do a live show at WADO. For a period of 20 years, Jocko hosted and promoted hundreds of shows at the world famous Apollo Theatre. He was also the first African-American to host a daily live television show in New York City.

In the early 70's, Jocko was publisher of Philly Talk magazine, a slick monthly publication geared toward the upwardly mobile black population in the Philadelphia area. In the early 80's, Jocko founded Get Ready, Incorporated, a Philadelphia company which developed and distributed educational materials that used "rap music" to relay the curriculum to help inspire and motivate today's youth to acquire basic cognitive skills. Mr. Henderson died in 2000.
