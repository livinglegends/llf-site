The measure of a man may not be summed up in monetary value of dollars and cents but on the accomplishments he has made to help someone else survive against the odds. That odds maker is radio legend "Diamond" Jim Sears. 

Diamond Jim, as he is known by coworkers in the radio industry, has had the unique experience of having served as one of the few pioneer Black radio salespersons in major markets and achieving the title of General Manager. He began his career more than 30 years ago in the budding years of Black radio. He worked part-time at WSID-AM in Baltimore before taking a full-time position at WEBB-AM. There, while working with Program Director Jerry Boulding, Mr. Sears divided his time between being an on-air personality and a station account executive. He accepted the challenge of becoming General Manager in 1968, a year before the station was purchased by recording artist James Brown. 

"Mr. Brown was not only the hardest working man in show business, he was a hard-nosed businessman who wanted WEBB to generate revenue. He used to call me up at 3am to discuss business," recalls Mr. Sears. "I worked with James Brown for more than 12 years, and during that time he helped me to help others. We organized events to feed the hungry, distribute toys at Christmas and extended a helping hand to our listening audience the community of Baltimore." 

During that time span, Mr. Sears did a little more than help the community. He developed the community, giving young men an opportunity to pick up a 
microphone to become a disc jockey. For many, that opportunity helped establish a foundation for their future. The confidence they developed on-air led to career successes. Among those persons who were impacted by opportunities on WEBB-AM during Mr. Searsâ€™ tenure were Kirby Carmichael, Chuck Woodson, Bernard Miller, Kwesi Mfume, and Curtis Anderson to name a few. 

Mr. Sears left the Northeast and headed south to Miami, Florida in 1979 and began a new phase in his life working with a recognized "Living Legend," Jerry Rushin of WEDR Radio.  He embraced the South Florida community, working as a salesman of WEDR and at The Miami Times, a 74-year old weekly publication which had never missed an edition. "I have been blessed to have worked for three great Black men, each of them leaders in their own right: Jerry Rushin, Garth Reeves and James Brown, the godfathers of radio, print and music," he proudly exclaimed. 

After ten years of working radio and print, Mr. Sears established his own firm. Until his death in 2011, he enjoyed spending his days on the golf course and developing promotions and special events in the Miami area.
