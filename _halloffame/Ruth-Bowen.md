There's no doubt that without Ruth Bowen, any number of today's legendary R&B stars might not have enjoyed the incredible success they've had over the last few decades. Starting out in public relations, working with acts like Dave Brubeck and Earl Bostic, the wife of the late Billy Bowen of The Ink Spots managed the great Dinah Washington for several years before she formed Queens Artists, which later became Queen Booking Corporation.   

During her tenure as the premier Black booking agent, Ruth worked with literally everybody from Aretha Franklin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Richard Pryor, The Isley Brothers, Dionne Warwick, The Dells, Millie Jackson, Kool & The Gang and Ray Charles, as well as Motown's early 60's stable of emergent new artists including The Supremes and "Little" Stevie Wonder.
