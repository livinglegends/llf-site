For as far back as she could remember, Violet Brown has always marched to the beat of a different drummer. From an early age she knew that music would be an integral part of her life. Her mother, a musician, took her on several trips to local record stores and at age six she bought her first record, "The Twist" by Chubby Checker. This started her obsessive "dance" with music - a dance that would last the rest of her life. By the time she started junior high school, she was the proud owner of an impressive and extensive record collection and was called upon to supply and play the music for school affairs.

  At 12 years of age, Ms. Brown started working in a retail record outlet, and by 15 she was running her own record store. When the sale of compilation 4 and 8 track tapes became illegal, she joined the staff of Wallach’s Music City (a popular record chain on the West Coast), and soon after was recruited by the company that distributed product to Wallach’s, Nehi Distributors. In 1976 at age 22, Violet Brown started what was to be a long and distinguished career with The Wherehouse, and moved swiftly through the ranks holding positions as Store Manager, District Manager, and Manager of Order Service.  She was the Urban Music Buyer for the chain and was responsible for advertising, promoting and purchasing new urban product for 224 stores.

 Always looking for the opportunity to challenge her abilities in other contexts, Ms. Brown worked as an A&R Consultant for Hollywood Records in 1990, and produced her first compilation CD "Slow Jamz From Back in the Day" for Quality Records in 1995. In 1997, her sophomore production effort spawned the highly successful, "In the Beginning There Was Rap" - a tribute to "old school" rap that featured the talents of some of hip hop's biggest names and brightest stars. The list includes Snoop Dogg, Wu Tang Clan, The Dogg Pound, Master P, Cypress Hill and Sean "Puffy" Combs. The album was certified gold in the USA and Canada, and a mere 27,000 units shy of being platinum.  

But even this accomplishment loses its metallic luster when compared to the many awards and accolades that she has received over the course of her more than 25 year professional career in record retail. She has won almost 40 national display contests, been awarded the "Employee of The Year" twice, named to Source Magazine's "Hip Hop Power 30" for two consecutive years and chosen to attend a dinner for Nelson Mandela. The list of recording artists for whom she has organized and orchestrated "in store" appearances reads like the Who's Who of music. The list includes The Jackson 5, Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, Al Green, Anita Baker, Jodeci, MC Hammer, LI Cool J, Luther Vandross, Mary J. Blige, New Edition, and many, many more. And all the while, just as in her junior and high school days, Violet Brown continued to hone her DJ skills and was much sought after by local dance clubs. She formed a DJ service in 1979 that serviced many local and regional customers and remained active until 1995.
 
Violet Brown is still marching to the beat of a drum - her drum! She sponsors rap competitions adjudicated by celebrity judges, and hosts an annual block party that attracts thousands of local residents and participants from near and far. Today, many artists seek her advice in selecting labels, choosing singles and soliciting producers. Brown’s many years of service in the industry are a true testimony to her dedication and determination. The respect and reputation that she enjoys is a tribute to her honesty and humility.

 In her time, Violet Brown has witnessed many changes in music and its configuration. She has worked with 4 track, 8 tracks, 45s, LPs, cassettes, CDs and digital downloads but one thing has remained constant, and that's her love for music and others.
