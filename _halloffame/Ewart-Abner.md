Chicago-born Ewart Abner's career as a record executive included stints with two of the most important labels in the history of contemporary R&B and with a musical legend. It was in 1954 that Mr. Abner joined Vee Jay Records as General Manager, and during his total of 12 years with the company he rose to become President and a third partner in the Black-owned independent label, whose diverse roster included (at different times in its history) Pop (The Beatles, The Four Seasons), Doo-Wop (The Eldorados, The Spaniels), R&B (Jerry Butler, Gene Chandler, The Impressions), Gospel (The Staple Singers, The Swan Silvertones), Blues (Jimmy Reed, John Lee Hooker), and Jazz (Freddie Hubbard and Wayne Shorter).

  In 1967, Mr. Abner joined Motown Records, initially as Vice-president of the label's management division, becoming company President in 1973. From 1978 to 1987, he managed superstar Stevie Wonder, and after a three-year period of retirement, was named Assistant to Berry Gordy, Jr., Chairman of The Gordy Company. A former president of the Black Music Association from 1984-85, Mr. Abner also founded the American Record Manufacturing and Distributing in 1958, a forerunner to NARM.
