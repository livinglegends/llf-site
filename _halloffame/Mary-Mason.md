She's been tagged a "Philadelphia Institution." Humanitarian, on-air personality and entrepreneur, Mary Mason has been involved with radio since 1958 when she joined station WHAT. During a 28-year run, Mary switched from gospel to popular music and became the first black radio talk show host in October 1970.

  The co-owner of several radio stations throughout the country, Ms. Mason formed the Mary Mason Community Foundation several years ago. The organization has been responsible for distributing close to a half-million dollars to radio disc jockeys who are in financial need.
 
A founding member of the Black Music Association, a National Board Member of the Martin Luther King Foundation for Non-Violence and a National Board Member and Executive Vice-President of the National Black Media Coalition, Ms. Mason ministered to people through her highly-rated and much-loved daily morning talk show on WHAT in Philadelphia until 1986 and then on WWDB in the same city.
