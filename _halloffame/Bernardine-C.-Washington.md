A four-year honor student from DuSable High School and a product of Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, Bernadine C. Washington was significantly involved in community activities most of her adult life. Her positive approach to any program made her a "first" in many of her endeavors. 

Before entering the broadcast field, she was the first woman of color to become a Fashion Buyer for a department store. She traveled to New York and California markets every six weeks purchasing the latest in styles. Bern, as she is fondly called, was a "smartly groomed oddity" when attending the fashion showings of famous designers, since she was a one-of-a-kind female in the room. Ebony Magazine's New York photographer and writer accompanied her during one of her unique journeys, which resulted in a five page spread in the national Johnson publication. Because of the innovative ideas she brought to the store, she was made their Community Relations Director in addition to her fashion duties. 

Her dulcet voice tones and genial personality when commentating fashion shows brought her to the attention of the entrepreneurs of L and P Broadcasting Company who were forming brand new radio stations in Chicago...the Original WVON-AM and WSDM-FM, (today WGCI-AM/FM). Influenced into leaving the store, she was hired as the station's Women's Director and eventually promoted to Director of Marketing. 

Through her natural enthusiasm in those positions as well as in-depth community interest, the Bern Club was formed. Comprised of 700 plus females from all walks of life in all areas of the city, the station named the organization for her. When L and P Broadcasting purchased an additional facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin...WNOV, another Bern Club was effectuated. During its 18 year existence, the group awarded $98,000 in academic scholarships to deserving African-American female high school graduates and to charitable organizations of merit. She is a role model guest speaker in the public schools and Women's Day speaker in many community churches and spearheaded a book drive to donate books to area schools. 

Another first was added to her accomplishments when she was named Vice President of both facilities. Not only was she the first Black female named to this high post in a major market whose signature appeared on all company checks, but the first female period! Realizing that Operation PUSH was the only open forum for the community at that time, one of her first undertakings was in persuading the owners of the company never to charge the organization for their weekly broadcasts. It is still a practice today. It was during this period that she became the first female to receive an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Chicago State University. 

Small in stature and meticulous in appearance, Bernadine C. Washington was noted for her warm personality and meaningful community activities. She was a member of the Board of Directors of the Joint Negro Appeal and was a member of the administrative team of the late Mayor Harold Washington and Honorable Eugene Sawyer. Prior to her death, she served as Director of Management Services to the Mayor's Chicago Commission on Human Relations. For 21 years, she was married to Ed "Nassau Daddy" Cook, who preceded her in death.
