Harold “Hal” Jackson was a popular radio and television personality and one of the most respected men in the communications industry. As a radio pioneer, Mr. Jackson experienced many "firsts" that assisted in opening doors for other aspiring Black broadcasters, musicians and performers. He was the first Black radio announcer in network radio; the first Black host of a jazz show on the ABC network; the first Black play-by-play sports announcer on radio in the country; the first black host inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 1990 and the first black inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1995. Until his death in 2012 at the age of 96, he hosted the “Sunday Classics” radio program, which was rated #1 by Arbitron in its time slot for many years on WBLS in New York.  He was on the air over 75 years.

Born in Charleston, SC, Mr. Jackson grew up in Washington, D.C., and attended Howard University there. He launched his broadcasting career by announcing the school's home games and the American Negro League games over station WOOK. Later, he could be heard daily on three different stations - a nightly news interview program over Washington's WIMX, a five hour sports show on Baltimore's WSID, and another sports show on WANN in Annapolis. 

He went into television, hosting a variety show that was broadcast from the stage of the Howard Theater. The show gave him the opportunity to interview such historic figures such as Mary McLeod Bethune, Dr. Charles Drew, Dr. Ralph Bunche, Adam Clayton Powell and A. Phillip Randolph. 

For over 23 years, Mr. Jackson was the Executive Producer and host of the Talented Teens International competition, which highlights the intelligence, creativity and talents of young minority women 13-17 years of age. The ladies are given the opportunity to display their talents and compete for educational scholarships and trips abroad. 

In 1989, Hal Jackson's 50 years of broadcasting and his major contributions to youth and charitable causes were acknowledged by Honorable Mervyn M. Dymally of California on the floor of the House of Representatives, which became a part of the Congressional Record. 

This gentle and charitable man lived a life devoted to sharing his talent and time to helping those less fortunate. His career and lifestyle can be summarized by the theme he has chosen for his radio programs — "It's nice to be important, but it is more important to be nice."
