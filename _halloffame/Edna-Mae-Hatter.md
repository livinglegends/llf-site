At an early age Eula Mae Hatter accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as her personal Savior, and she has been in his service ever since. Her mission is to spread the gospel news through her work and the example of her life.

Born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Eula Mae Hatter attended East Baton Rouge public schools and later furthered her education at Southern University. Her love for Christ created a burning desire within for her to testify to His goodness and mercies. Ms. Hatter realized that the medium of radio provided a powerful vehicle for mass communication. She knew that the messages of hope and truth that were shared in thousands of local churches would find homes in the hearts of many through radio broadcast. In 1954, she worked on her first gospel show â€œThe Cousin Carrie Gospel Hour," and for the next 11 years she ministered to thousands of listeners, inspiring many and touching the souls of many more. In 1965, she changed the name of the show to the "Eula Mae Hatter Gospel Hour." The show quickly gained popularity and soon became one of the top-rated shows on WXOX, extending across nine parishes in Louisiana and making Eula Mae Hatter, the first black woman to carry a gospel radio program within 100 miles of Baton Rouge.

Employed by Citywide Broadcasting as a gospel show hostess, Ms. Hatter had no peers! For 40 years at WXOX, she became the personification of the precepts and doctrines of her show: an embodiment of goodness and light. Affectionately dubbed by friends and followers as the "First Lady of Gospel," Eula Mae Hatter blazed the trails carrying her torch of truth. At 9:00 a.m. five days a week, listeners tuned in for the very best in gospel music and oftentimes her show served as a clearinghouse for gospel news.

Requests for appearances at seminars, conventions and religious programs poured into her office on a constant basis and she traveled extensively throughout Louisiana and its surrounding states to serve as guest emcee, guest speaker, guest soloist, or in whatever capacity was required. Her witness for the Lord was not confined to the 60 seconds of her one hour gospel show, it consumed all of her time, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. She was an active member of the New Prospect Missionary Baptist Church, and the Publicity Chairman of the Emmanuel Baptist Association. Eula Mae Hatter also served as the musician for the New Prospect and Greater Arlington Baptist Churches as well as a member of the James Cleveland Gospel Music Workshop of America and the Gospel Announcers Guild.

Her over 40 years of incomparable service at WXOX and more importantly its listening audience, received recognition by both Governors of the State of Louisiana, Edwin W. Edwards and Charles "Buddy" Roemer. While Eula Mae Hatter affirmed that her service to God and her fellow man is "the purpose of her creation," and demands that "all praises are due to her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ," community organizations, civic groups and political figures, have felt the need to honor her with numerous awards. Former President of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. recognized Eula Mae Hatter for her service to the community, as did the Louisiana State Representatives. The Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. has also honored Eula Mae Hatter with an Award of Distinction.

Major television networks, The Baton Rouge Daily Newspaper and the bi-monthly periodical, The Woman, are among the many electronic and print media that paid tribute to Eula Mae Hatter's long and distinguished "labor of love." To all of this, Eula Mae Hatter responded with humility, reverence and dignified grace.  She died in 2000.
 
 "... Then sings my soul, My Savior Lord to Thee; How Great Thou Art, How Great Thou Art!"
