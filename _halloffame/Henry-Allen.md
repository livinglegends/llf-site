Long before there was a Russell Simmons, Andre Harrell or Sean "Puffy" Combs, Henry Allen was carving a path for the Black executive in the music industry.  He has the distinction of being the first Black Vice President and the first Senior Vice President of a major label. A little known fact is that he was president of his own label, Cotillion Records, distributed through a major record company, Atlantic Records, and making him a true pioneer - a true living legend!   

Born in Ohio, Henry Allen attended Springfield High School and later Wilberforce University. He took a job as a jukebox repairman before moving to New York in search of fame and fortune. In the big city he found work at Tops Records and later moved on to join the staff at Atlantic Records as a stock room clerk. His pristine work ethics and dedication to duty, clearly distinguished him as an exemplary employee and his superiors could not ignore his ability to always get the job done. Job promotions came, and each time Mr. Allen met them with new resolve and a sense of responsibility. He was soon in charge of local promotion, and then regional promotion and later national promotion. The next step was to be appointed as the Vice President of the Black Music Division.

  His rise through the ranks and up the ladder of success is not attributed to being able to produce a hit track, but rather to good old fashioned hard work! In his position as Record Executive, Mr. Allen had in his charge the careers of some of the biggest names in show business - Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, and the undisputed Queen of Soul - Aretha Franklin... just to name a few.

  Always forging new frontiers, the forever progressive Henry Allen set his sights on a new goal. In an unprecedented move, he formed an independent label as a subsidiary of Atlantic Records. He was now at the helm of his own ship as the President of Cotillion Records. His roster of artists comprised of an impressive array of young talent the likes of - Stacy Lattisaw, Johnny Gill, Slave and Sister Sledge. Their successes are just mere reflections of the vision and creative genius of Henry Allen.   

Many things have changed in the music industry since Henry Allen travelled the world, presided at board meetings and called the shots at Atlantic Records, but one thing has not....   "There is no substitute for decency, honesty and integrity."
