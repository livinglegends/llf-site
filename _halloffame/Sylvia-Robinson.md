Sylvia Robinson's creative instinct kept her on the cutting edge of the music business. She also understood the importance of having your own and worked toward helping other independent entrepreneurs to maintain their own as well. 

Ms. Robinson was born Sylvia Vanderpool in New York City. Her musical talents were recognized by her parents at an early age. She learned piano as a child and at the age of 12 was recording for Savoy Records. In high school, she was taught guitar by Mickey Baker. At 16, she teamed up with Baker to record the hit single "Love Is Strange." They continued as a duo until Baker moved to France.   By that time Ms. Vanderpool had met Joe Robinson and their alliance evolved into a marriage and business partnership. In the early '70's they formed All Platinum Records. It was here that Ms. Robinson honed in on her writing and producing skills. Her biggest successes came with the Moments ("Not on the Outside," "Sexy Mama") and her own rendition of "Pillow Talk." She would produce another top 10 hit with Shirley Goodman's "Shame, Shame, Shame," which became one of the first disco hits. 

All Platinum acquired the Chess catalogue in 1975. They were able to reissue some of the Chess classics before running into financial problems in 1978. In the autumn of 1979, Ms. Robinson came up with an idea that would change the music business forever. While attending a disco party she happened upon these guys who were rapping into a microphone. Her instinct told her that this was an idea, and as she says, "the rest is history." 

This concept gave birth to the Sugar Hill Record Company. They released "Rapper's Delight" by the Sugar Hill Gang, which became an underground hit and a number one song in many countries. Sugar Hill went on to record hits by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Melle Mel, Sequence and other rappers. 

Ms. Robinson made another controversial move when she released the Sugar Hill hits to the smaller distributors and mom-and-pop stores before shipping them to the larger chains. By this time, her three sons had joined the family business. Their efforts helped to keep the music young and alive. Sugar Hill kept the hits coming while critics believed rap would not last. It would take five years for the major labels to take rap seriously. 

Ms. Robinson continued her revolutionary concepts under her new record label, Diamond Head Records, releasing a song by Kyro.   Ms. Robinson's earlier songs can still be heard via samples on current rap records.  Ice Cube and Dr. Dre have both used her music. 

Sylvia lived in Englewood, New Jersey until her death in 2011.
