Not only is Maxx Kidd a living legend, he is a bridge who links the soul music of the 60s to the go-go and hip hop sounds of today. As a young man in West Virginia, Maxx was inspired to start a career in music after meeting Nat "King" Cole in the nightclub his father owned. He soon acquired a job at a local drive-in restaurant as a Calypso singer and, except for a brief stint in the Army, he has worked in the music industry ever since.   

Mr. Kidd arrived in Washington, D.C. in 1960 and quickly earned a reputation as a devoted, professional musical talent. He caught the attention of Curtis Mayfield, who was then heading his record company, Curtom Records. At Curtom, Mr. Kidd began to produce recordings by artists such as Jerry Butler, Gene Chandler, Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers, and the Stridelles. Some of the hits that feature his trademark sound are "Teacher to Preacher" by Gene Chandler, "I Like Candy" by the Stridelles, "I Need Money" and "Blow Your Whistle" by Chuck Brown.   

In the late 1970's, Mr. Kidd helped to pioneer a brand new sound that became known as "Go-Go" music. Working with bands such as Trouble Funk, EU, and Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers, Maxx Kidd's production technique became legendary. A movie titled "Good to Go" told the story of Mr. Kidd's contributions to the evolution of this highly charged new music. At the same time, he was starting his own record company, Tedd Records.

 As an independent promoter and marketer, Maxx Kidd's list of clients included the O'Jays, Lou Rawls, Van McCoy, Johnny Taylor, the Temptations, Carrie Lucas and Shalamar. He has worked with nearly every major record label, including Columbia, Motown, MCA and Polygram.

  Mr. Kidd's achievements in his field were recognized by then-Mayor Sharon Pratt-Kelly of Washington D.C, who placed him on her Task Force for Entertainment, which helped to promote the city as a place where national acts and companies will find an eager audience.  He has also led seminars at Howard University, the University of D.C, American University, and the city's public schools. He has already won awards from Jack the Rapper, the Black Music Association and Black Radio Exclusive (BRE).
