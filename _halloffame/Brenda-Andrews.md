Brenda Andrews is the former Senior Vice President of Rondor Music International Music, the world's largest independent music publisher. Ebony magazine recognized and included Ms. Andrews in the article, "One Hundred Best and Brightest Black Women in Corporate America". The title says it all.

  Ms. Andrews’ ingredients for her success combine strong spirituality with hard work.  Her ascent took time. Her remarkable career began over 30 years ago when she was hired as a receptionist at Rondor Music International.  Even then she was sure of what she wanted - to be a major force in the entertainment industry.   

Her hard work, faith, loyalty and talent got her there. Brenda's days are filled meeting with the creative staff and working with writers. At Rondor, she was considered “The Godmother” because of her open door policy and her sincere regard for those with whom she worked.

Because of Ms. Andrews’ talent of anticipating those needs, she has had many hit songs with scores of top artists including Deborah Cox, Toni Braxton, Whitney Houston, Natalie Cole and Diana Ross.   

The roster of writers that she worked with is equally impressive: Shep Crawford, "Nobody's Supposed To be Here" and "We Can't Be Friends",  Will Jennings, "My Heart Will Go On," from the motion picture Titanic.  Ms. Andrews has a strong sense of social responsibility, which was noted by her peers when the NAACP presented her with the Community Image Award and recognized her with their salute of Black Women of Achievement.   

In 1994, the International Association of African American Music honored her for promoting, protecting and perpetuating African American music globally. The Black Entertainment and Sports Lawyers Association also honored her that same year.   

The National Black MBA named Brenda Andrews its Music Publishing Executive of the Year and Impact Trade Magazine and its annual Power Jam Conference proudly established The Brenda Andrews Music Publishing Award. Brenda has served on the Board of Directors with the Los Angeles Urban League, Big Sisters Inc. and the advisory Board of Kwanzaa. As busy as she is, Brenda always has time to devote to her family. She attributes her achievements to their unwavering support and also to a steadfast belief that with having God in one's life, anything is possible.

  Although now retired the “Godmother” is still giving advice to today’s music executives.
