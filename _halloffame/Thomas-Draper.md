Tom Draper began his career in the music industry in 1965 with RCA Records in Detroit as a consumer electronics sales trainee, where he progressed to National Promotion Director in the music division. From there, his career flourished with an array of executive management positions at Warner Communications/Time Warner.

One of his most interesting positions was at Warner Communications as Vice President of Community Relations. In this position, he was able to expand the organization's image in minority communities and reaffirm its commitment to responsible corporate outreach by forging alliances with leaders of not-for-profit organizations.

Other notable milestones during his career at Warner Communications/Time Warner included developing media concepts and public relation strategies, such as the Paul Simon U.S. and Canadian Graceland Benefit Concert Tour. During the tour, receptions were planned to discuss UN sanctions against South Africa relative to artist collaborations and activities.  

Mr. Draper also produced the Al Jarreau/Roberta Flack and Friends Concert at the world famous Apollo Theatre to benefit the Correctional/Osborne Associations. He conceived "Beat the Odds" as an effort to reach out to the younger generation. The event is a program for the Children's Defense Fund, which draws on music industry executives to honor young people for excellence in pursuing their goals while surmounting tremendous odds. The program is now celebrated in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Washington, DC, Minneapolis and New York. 

In March of 1991, he was presented with the first annual "Pioneer in Music" Award from the National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters, Inc. He was also a guest lecturer for the "Portraits in Rhythm and Blues" series at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.
