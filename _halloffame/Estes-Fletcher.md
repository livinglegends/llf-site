In the business since 1955, Estes Fletcher, owner of Fletcher's One Stop Records & Tapes, began as a small neighborhood record store owner in the Chicago-area, carrying a full line of Gospel, R&B, Blues, Jazz and more recently, Hip-Hop music.

"I got into the business because of my love of music", says Fletcher, who remembers the days when his store stocked 78s, 45s and 33 1/3 EPS. Over the years, Fletcher's expanded to five locations across the city and a video store.

In 1955, he made the conversion from mom and pop owner to One Stop distributor, serving the Illinois, Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin areas. "The opportunity for profit is much greater with a one-stop", says Fletcher, "and at the time there was not much competition."

Still a family-run establishment, Fletecher prides himself on operating a punctual, well-stocked one stop with knowledgeable, friendly staff. His daughter Susan, recently joined the company as manager.

'The music business is more professional these days", he says. 'Before people were in the business as a hobby, supplemented with regular employment and now most people today are strictly record people. Susan is helping to bring a professional air to the business. She has a modern approach.
