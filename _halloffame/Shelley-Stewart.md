For more years than he could remember, Shelley Stewart woke up at 3:30 a.m. so he can be on the air at 5:30 for his morning show on WATV in Birmingham, Alabama. His radio career began in 1949 at WEDR where he became known as "Shelley the Playboy." It was his outspoken stand on race relations that singled him out as an on-air jock, and through his years at stations in and around Birmingham,  Mr. Stewart became the most popular radio personality in the area. 

In addition to his radio shows, Mr. Stewart promoted shows throughout the South through the 60's, working with acts like Sam Cooke, Little Richard, Lou Rawls, Bobby Bland, James Brown and B.B. King. In 1964, he began a stint with the legendary Otis Redding as his personal P.R. representative. His association with Phil Walden Management led to work with acts like Sam & Dave, Isaac Hayes and Johnnie Taylor. While pursuing P.R. ventures, Stewart remained in radio and had been on the air continuously for 43 years, during which time he had never been out of the Top 5 in ratings. A mentor to industry stalwarts like Ray Harris, Hank Spann, Tom Joyner and Sidney Miller, Stewart was co-owner of WATV and ran Shelley Stewart & Associates, which worked on image-building for individuals and municipalities.
